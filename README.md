Welcome to the interactive section of the Cursor Framework workshop!

## üèÅ Getting Started

To get your local environment set up, please follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You'll need `curl` to be installed to fetch the `uv` installer. Most Unix-like systems have it pre-installed.

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation

This project uses a `Makefile` to simplify the setup process.

You can install `uv` separately if you wish:
```bash
make uv-install
```

To install all dependencies and configure pre-commit hooks, run the following command:

```bash
make dev-setup
```

This single command will:
1.  **Check for `uv`**: It verifies if `uv` is installed and, if not, downloads and installs it for you.
2.  **Sync Dependencies**: It runs `uv sync --all-extras` to install all required packages from `pyproject.toml`.
3.  **Install Pre-commit Hooks**: It executes `uv run pre-commit install` to set up the git hooks for automated code quality checks before each commit.

After the setup is complete, your environment is ready for development!
