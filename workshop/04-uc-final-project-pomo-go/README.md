# UseCase 4 (Grand Finale): Building "Pomo-Go" from Scratch

### üéØ The Goal
To provide a live, end-to-end demonstration of the entire Cursor Framework by building a practical and visually engaging Terminal Pomodoro Timer. This project will showcase how to seamlessly transition from research and planning to test-driven implementation and final polishing.

### üí° The Project: "Pomo-Go"
A command-line Pomodoro timer built in Python. It will feature:
- A visual, real-time countdown with a progress bar.
- Distinct states for "Work", "Short Break", and "Long Break".
- Audio notifications when a timer cycle ends.
- Customizable timer durations via CLI arguments.

### üöÄ The Full Framework Workflow

This demo is structured in distinct phases, each designed to highlight a specific Custom Mode and solve a real-world development challenge.

---

### **Phase 1: Research & Discovery (`Research` Mode)**
- **Objective:** Determine the best tools for the job.
- **Problem to Solve:** How to build a rich, interactive terminal UI in Python?
- **Demo Script:**
    > "I want to build a visually appealing Pomodoro timer in the terminal using Python. What are the best modern libraries for creating rich text, progress bars, and colors? Also, what's a simple, cross-platform way to play a notification sound?"
- **Expected Outcome:** The AI will recommend libraries like `rich` for the UI and `playsound` for audio, demonstrating how to quickly resolve technical uncertainties.

---

### **Phase 2: The Blueprint (`SpecsForge` Mode)**
- **Objective:** Create a detailed, unambiguous project specification.
- **Problem to Solve:** Moving from a vague idea to a concrete plan before writing any code.
- **Demo Script:**
    > "Okay, let's design our Pomodoro timer, 'pomo-go', using `rich` and `playsound`. I need you to help me create the full specification. The timer needs 'Work' (25 min), 'Short Break' (5 min), and 'Long Break' (15 min) states. A long break should occur after four 'Work' cycles. The user must be able to customize these times via CLI arguments."
- **Expected Outcome:** `SpecsForge` will generate a `SPECS.md` file defining the state machine, CLI arguments, and core requirements, providing a solid blueprint.

---

### **Phase 3: The Implementation (`TDV` Mode)**
- **Objective:** Build the core logic with a rigorous test-first methodology.
- **Problem to Solve:** Ensuring the core application logic is robust and reliable before adding any UI.
- **Demo Script:**
    > "Using the `@SPECS.md`, let's implement the core logic for 'pomo-go'. Let's start with the state machine and timer, without any UI. Create a TDD plan for this."
- **Expected Outcome:** The AI will guide a Red-Green-Refactor cycle, creating tests for the state transitions first, then writing the code to make them pass. This showcases the power of building a tested "brain" for the application.

---

### **Phase 4: Bringing it to Life (Standard Chat or `Yolo` Mode)**
- **Objective:** Connect the tested logic to the UI and add polish.
- **Problem to Solve:** Integrating backend logic with a user-facing interface.
- **Demo Script:**
    > "The core logic is tested. Now, let's build the terminal UI using the `rich` library. Create a function that displays a progress bar and a live countdown timer. When the timer finishes, use the `playsound` library to play a notification sound. Let's make the output look really cool! üé®"
- **Expected Outcome:** A visually satisfying and functional application, demonstrating the final integration step and adding a "wow" factor for the audience.
