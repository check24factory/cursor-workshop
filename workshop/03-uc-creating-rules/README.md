### Workshop Steps:

1.  **Learn the Syntax:** Use the `@docs` feature with a web search to find and understand Jira's Markdown syntax.
2.  **Create the Rule:** Prompt Cursor to create a new `.mdc` file in your `.cursor/rules` directory. Make sure to actively reference '@01-mdc-guidelines.mdc' e.g.:
    > "Create a new Cursor Rule to enforce consistent formatting for Jira tickets. Stick very close the guidelines showcased in '@01-mdc-guidelines.mdc'."
4.  **Test It:** Prompt the AI to draft a Jira ticket using your new rule to see it in action.
