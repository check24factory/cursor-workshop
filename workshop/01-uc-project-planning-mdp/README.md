### Workshop Steps:

1.  **Create a Plan File:** Make a new file: `sales-dashboard-plan.md`.
2.  **Activate MDP Mode:** Select the `MDP` custom mode in the chat.
3.  **Initial Prompt:** Ask the AI to create a project plan for a "Quarterly Sales Performance Dashboard".
    -   *Example: "Create a project plan for a 'Quarterly Sales Performance Dashboard'. Include sections for goals, stakeholders, features, and open questions."*
4.  **Iterate:** Use follow-up prompts to add details like stakeholders (`'Head of Sales'`) and features (`'Total Revenue by Region'`).
5.  **Review the Plan:** Note how the plan is now structured, centralized, and ready for version control.
