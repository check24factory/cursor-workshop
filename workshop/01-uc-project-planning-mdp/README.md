# UseCase 1: Project Plan Brainstorming with MDP Mode

### üéØ The Goal
To demonstrate how to take a vague, high-level idea and use the **MDP (Markdown-Driven Planner) Mode** to transform it into a structured, actionable project plan, right inside your editor.

### üíº The Real-World Scenario
**The Problem:** A Product Manager has a new feature idea: "We need a new quarterly performance dashboard for our sales team." The idea is raw, the requirements are undefined, and the stakeholders haven't been consulted.

**The Pain Point:** This usually leads to scattered notes in a separate app, endless clarification meetings, and requirements that are ambiguous and constantly changing.

### üöÄ The Cursor Framework Solution
Using the **MDP Mode**, we can tackle this systematically, creating a clear, version-controlled plan that serves as the single source of truth from day one.

### ü§ñ Live Demo Script
1.  **Create the file:** Start by creating a new file: `workshop/01-uc-project-planning-mdp/sales-dashboard-plan.md`.
2.  **Activate MDP Mode:** In the chat, select the `MDP` custom mode.
3.  **Initial Prompt:**
    > "I need to plan a new feature: a 'Quarterly Sales Performance Dashboard'. It should show key metrics for our sales team. Can you help me create a structured project plan for this? Start with a basic template covering key areas like goals, stakeholders, features, and open questions."
4.  **Iterate and Refine:** The AI will generate a Markdown template. Now, engage with it to flesh out the details.
    > "Okay, for stakeholders, let's list 'Head of Sales', 'Sales Operations', and 'Data Engineering Lead'. For the 'Key Features' section, let's add 'Total Revenue by Region', 'Top 10 Deals Closed', and 'Lead Conversion Rate Over Time'. What technical considerations should we add?"
5.  **Show the Outcome:** In just a few minutes, you have a well-organized project plan. Highlight that this file is now:
    *   **Centralized:** All ideas are in one place.
    *   **Structured:** Easy for anyone to read and understand.
    *   **Version-Controlled:** Can be committed to Git to track its evolution.
