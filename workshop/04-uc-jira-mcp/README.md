# ⚡️ 4. The Jira MCP Superpower

**Goal:** Connect Cursor to Jira and create tickets directly from the editor, using the rule we just built.

---

### Workshop Steps:

1.  **Generate Your Jira API Token:**
    -   Go to [your Atlassian profile](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens).
    -   Click `Create API token`.
    -   Name it `Cursor-Workshop` and copy the generated token. **Save it—you won't see it again!**

2.  **Configure MCP:**
    -   You will be given an `mcp.json` file.
    -   Open it and fill in these three placeholders:
        -   `JIRA_URL`: `https://your-company.atlassian.net`
        -   `JIRA_USERNAME`: `your.email@company.com`
        -   `JIRA_API_TOKEN`: The token you just created.
    -   Save the file. Cursor will automatically connect.

3.  **Find Your Project:** Gather your project key from Jira.

4.  **Create a Ticket:** Use the AI and your rule from the last session to draft a ticket.
    -   *Example: "Using @my-jira-rule.mdc, create a bug ticket in project PROJ for 'Login button is broken on mobile' with high priority."*

5.  **Verify:** Check Jira to see your new ticket!
6.  **Refine:** Refine the ticket interactively with the AI.
