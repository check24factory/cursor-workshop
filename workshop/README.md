# ðŸš€ Live Workshop Demos

Welcome to the live demo section of the Cursor Framework workshop! Each of the use cases below is designed to showcase a specific, powerful workflow that solves common workplace problems.

We will walk through these demos to illustrate how you can go from a vague idea to a structured plan, from a plan to a well-defined task, and from a requirement to a fully-tested toolâ€”all within a single, AI-native environment.

### 1. **[Project Plan Brainstorming with MDP Mode](./01-uc-project-planning-mdp/README.md)**
   - **Scenario:** A Product Manager needs to structure a new feature idea.
   - **Problem:** Vague requirements, scattered notes, endless meetings.
   - **Solution:** Use the **MDP Mode** to transform a raw idea into a structured, actionable project plan.

### 2. **[Rapidly Scaffolding a CLI Tool](./02-uc-cli-tool/README.md)**
   - **Scenario:** A Data Scientist needs a quick utility to extract text from PDFs.
   - **Problem:** Writing boilerplate for "simple" scripts is a tedious distraction.
   - **Solution:** Use the **stock agent** to generate a complete, working tool from a single prompt, perfect for rapid prototyping.

### 3. **[Crafting Your First Cursor Rule: Taming Jira Tickets](./03-uc-creating-rules/README.md)**
   - **Scenario:** A team wants to standardize how they write Jira tickets to improve clarity and consistency.
   - **Problem:** Inconsistent Jira tickets cause confusion and slow down development cycles.
   - **Solution:** Create a powerful Cursor Rule using the Docs feature to learn and enforce Jira's Markdown syntax, ensuring every ticket is perfectly formatted.

### 4. **[The Jira MCP Superpower: From Rule to Reality](./04-uc-jira-mcp/README.md)**
   - **Scenario:** With a formatting rule in place, it's time to put it to use by interacting with Jira directly from the editor.
   - **Problem:** Constantly switching between your editor and Jira's web interface is a major context-switching drain.
   - **Solution:** Set up the Jira Model Context Protocol (MCP) and use your newly created rule to create well-formatted tickets without ever leaving Cursor.

### 5. **[From Code to Specs: Documenting with SpecsForge](./05-uc-specs-forge/README.md)**
   - **Scenario:** A developer needs to create technical specifications for an existing, undocumented part of their project.
   - **Problem:** Writing detailed technical specs is time-consuming and often gets out of sync with the actual code.
   - **Solution:** Use the **SpecsForge Mode** to analyze existing code and generate comprehensive, accurate technical specifications automatically.
