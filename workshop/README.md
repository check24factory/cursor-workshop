# ðŸš€ Live Workshop Demos

Welcome to the live demo section of the Cursor Framework workshop! Each of the use cases below is designed to showcase a specific, powerful workflow that solves common workplace problems.

We will walk through these demos to illustrate how you can go from a vague idea to a structured plan, from a plan to a well-defined task, and from a requirement to a fully-tested toolâ€”all within a single, AI-native environment.
